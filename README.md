# Architecting-Solutions-Restaurant-app
This restaurant app uses AWS to provide a seamless dining experience. Customers scan a QR code to view the menu hosted on Amazon S3. Orders are processed via API Gateway and Kinesis Data Firehose into S3. Admins manage menus, while data is analyzed with Athena and visualized in QuickSight for insights on sales and customer trends.
