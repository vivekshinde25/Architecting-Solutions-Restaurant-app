# Architecture Optimizations

‚úÖ **Use Serverless for Menu Update System**  
**Actual Definition:**  
Replace the always-on EC2 instance that updates QR code menus with a serverless service like **AWS Lambda**, which automatically scales, only runs when triggered, and charges only for execution time.  
**Simple Words:**  
Instead of keeping a computer running all day just in case someone updates the menu, use a setup that ‚Äúwakes up‚Äù only when it‚Äôs needed, then goes back to sleep.  
**Real-World Example:**  
Imagine a coffee machine that only turns on when you need a cup, instead of staying hot 24/7.

‚úÖ **Add Amazon CloudFront for Menu Delivery**  
**Actual Definition:**  
Use **Amazon CloudFront** (a content delivery network) in front of the S3 bucket that stores restaurant menus, so content is cached closer to customers, loads faster, and reduces direct S3 requests (saving cost).  
**Simple Words:**  
Put a middleman who keeps copies of your files in many locations, so customers get them quicker without bothering the original storage every time.  
**Real-World Example:**  
Like storing bottled water in fridges all over town so people don‚Äôt have to come to your house every time they‚Äôre thirsty.

‚úÖ **Use Amazon Cognito Instead of API Gateway for Data Authentication**  
**Actual Definition:**  
Authenticate users with **Amazon Cognito** in the JavaScript code so they can send data directly to **Amazon Kinesis**, avoiding API Gateway and reducing costs.  
**Simple Words:**  
Let people log in directly and send info without going through an extra door that costs money to maintain.  
**Real-World Example:**  
Instead of having guests knock at the main gate and then the front door, give them a key so they can go straight in.

‚úÖ **Turn Architecture into a CloudFormation Template**  
**Actual Definition:**  
Use **AWS CloudFormation** to create an Infrastructure as Code template, allowing the entire architecture to be easily replicated in separate AWS accounts for different customers.  
**Simple Words:**  
Write down exact building instructions so you can recreate the same system anywhere without doing it by hand.  
**Real-World Example:**  
Like having IKEA instructions for your furniture so you can rebuild it in another house without guessing.

‚úÖ **Add Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff**  
**Actual Definition:**  
When requests fail, retry them gradually with increasing wait times between attempts, instead of flooding the system with constant retries.  
**Simple Words:**  
If the line is busy, wait a bit before calling again ‚Äî and wait longer if it keeps failing.  
**Real-World Example:**  
When you can‚Äôt get through to customer service, you call back after 1 minute, then 2 minutes, then 4 minutes, instead of pressing redial nonstop.

‚úÖ **Optimize Data for Amazon Athena**  
**Actual Definition:**  
Compress, partition, and convert data into columnar formats like **Parquet** to reduce the amount of data scanned by Athena, making queries faster and cheaper.  
**Simple Words:**  
Organize your data so Athena only looks at what‚Äôs needed and doesn‚Äôt waste time or money scanning everything.  
**Real-World Example:**  
Instead of looking through the whole filing cabinet for February‚Äôs receipts, keep them in a labeled ‚ÄúFebruary‚Äù folder that‚Äôs already neatly compressed.
